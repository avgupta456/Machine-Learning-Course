# Machine-Learning-Course

I followed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning course on Coursera during June, 2019. This repository contains programming exercises from this course. Topics covered include:

* **Supervised learning**: linear regression, logistic regresiion, neural networks, SVMs
* **Unsupervised learning**: k-means, PCA, anomaly detection
* **Special applications**: recommender systems, large scale machine learning
* **Advice on building ML systems**: bias/variance, learning curves, error analysis, ceiling analysis
